# Hi, I'm Sree 👋

I build AI agents and automation systems that solve real business problems.

Most of my work focuses on: **Voice AI agents**, **AI Governance**, **Healthcare AI**, and turning complex knowledge into executable systems.

I run [GVRN-AI](https://gvrn-ai.com), where I help businesses govern & deploy AI agents that actually work — from voice receptionists to intelligent automation workflows.

### What I work on

- 🎤 **Voice AI Agents**: VAPI, Retell, Make.com — production-ready phone agents
- 🤖 **AI Automation**: n8n, Make.com, LangChain — workflows that replace manual work
- 🏥 **Healthcare AI**: Building compliant AI systems for aged care and chronic disease management
- 🛡️ **AI Governance**: AIGP certification track, responsible AI frameworks
- 🧠 **Knowledge Engineering**: Systems that turn scattered information into actionable intelligence
